## What makes plastics so special?

Molecular structure 

Polymer means “many seas”

Ability to heat, melt and flow and when cooled retain all or most of its physical properties

Key to recyclability


## The first plastics made from fossil fuels are just over 100 years old …


In the late 19th century, piano keys and billiard balls, combs and various trinkets were made of elephant ivory.   With the elephant population at risk and ivory expensive and scarce, a billiards company in NYC offered a $10,000 reward to anyone who could come with an alternative.  Amateur inventor John Wesley Hyatt answered the challenge by developing  celluloid made of cellulose, a polymer found in all plants.  

In the early 20th century, oil companies had waste gases like ethylene coming out of the stacks of their refineries.   Chemists discovered they could use those gases as building blocks, or monomers, to create all sorts of novel polymers.  Instead of working only with polymers that already existed in nature, a world of possibilities opened up.  Anything could be made of plastic and it was cheap.

Came into widespread use after WWII (1950) and are found today in everything from cars to medical devices and food packaging.  Experts calculate 9.2 billion tons has been produced since then, and of that 6.9 billion tons have become waste.  


## For 30 years, China took in the world’s plastic waste. 


For the past few decades China was buying as much repurposed plastic as possible, especially from the 
     United States. In fact, scrap used to be America’s top export to China with plastic scrap exports 
     reaching $11.3 billion in 2011.

In the past, China would accept any standard of repurposed material and anything that couldn’t efficiently 
     be processed would end up in Chinese landfills. Although profitable, this practice resulted in mountains of 
     waste developing within China, posing both environmental and health risks.

But in 2017, China passed the National Sword policy banning plastic waste from being imported — 
      for the protection of the environment and people's health — beginning in January 2018

This means much more plastic waste in American landfills until the proper investments are made in 
      recycling infrastructure.

## Now that China won’t take it, what’s happening to the leftover waste?

Only 600 million tons has been recycled successfully (based on calculations done in 2017).  According to a study in 2015 between 5 – 15 million tons /year end up in our oceans.  Most of that carelessly dumped on land and eventually washed into the sea.  It’s unclear how long it would take for that plastic to completely biodegrade into its constituent molecules.  Estimates range from 450 years to never.

This isn’t a problem where we don’t know what the solution is.  We know how to dispose … we know how to recycle.  We must build the necessary institutions and systems to address the issue.

## Recycling

Single Stream Recycling refers to a system in which all kinds of recyclables such as plastics, paper, metals,
glass etc. are put into a single bin by consumers. Afterward, the recyclables are collected and transported 
to a Material Recovery Facility (MRF) where they are sorted and processed.

But this process is, ultimately, more expensive than sorting things before they got to the dump, and MRFs can’t 
separate recyclables quite as well as a system that never mixes them together to begin with.

25% of the stuff we try to recycle ends up Iandfills anyway because of contamination.

## Definition of Recyclable

Access to a collection system that will accept the item

Item can be sorted correctly and supplied into a market ready state meeting
      industry standards

The item can be further processed through a typical process cost effectively into
      new products


## In some parts of the world, using plastic is already illegal.

Kenya introduced one of the world’s toughest laws against plastic bags in 2017. 
      Now, Kenyans who are caught producing, selling, or even using plastic bags will risk 
      imprisonment of up to four years or fines of $40,000.
Other countries that have banned, partially banned, or taxed single-use plastic bags include China, 
     France, Rwanda, and Italy



## Polypropylene (PP, Resin Identification Code #5) 

Due to its balance of impact, heat and chemical resistance, along with stiffness and close dimensional tolerance, PP is one of the most widely used packaging resins. It is easily injection molded, blow molded or thermoformed into a bottle, pail, tray, tub or closure. Unlike some other polymers, the versatility of PP allows all components (label, body and closure) of many PP packages to be made of PP. This practice is beneficial to recycling.

PP properties are commonly enhanced with colorants, additives and fillers, or it is placed alongside other polymers in a multi-layer package. Each modification and addition to the natural PP in a package must be considered for its effect on the recycling stream. Non PP packaging features should either be economically removed from the PP in the typical recycling process or be compatible with PP in future uses. Of particular concern are mineral fillers or additives that cause the overall density of the blend to be greater than 1.00. The density of PP is .90-.92 so it floats in water. Density is an important property as reclaimers typically rely on float-sink tanks to separate polymers and to remove contaminants

PP is used in a wide number of industrial applications and postindustrial PP is an important source of PP that is collected and recycled. 


## What can I do at home?

Before you start throwing garbage in your recycle bins, check with your local recycling service to see what they recycle. This varies from service to service, and you can usually find a list of recyclable items on the company’s website. In addition, the recycling service website likely includes details about how to separate recyclables for curbside pick-up. A list of common household items you can recycle is below.


Junk Mail
Books
Shredded Paper
Ink Cartridges
Disposable Plates and Cups
CD and DVD Cases
Cardboard
Household Batteries
CFL Bulbs
Old TV’s
Power Cords


## What can I do at work?

Collect More – In addition to recycling paper, there are plenty of other waste items that can be diverted from landfills

Separate Organics – Collect food scraps, coffee grinds and other compostable materials seperately

Introduce Centralized Recycling Bins – Centralized recycling bins helps employees more likely to toss the waste in
                                                                     the right stream preventing stream contamination

Promote Litter-Less Lunches – Use reusable lunch bags and Tupperware-like containers avoiding paper or plastic bags

Don’t use Take-Out Cups – Disposable cups accounts for 2.5 million lbs of plastic waste per hour

Reduce Incoming Waste – Promote only recyclable or compostable materials from vendors

Reuse Supplies – An “Upcycle” station could provide an alternative to new supplies

Go Paperless -  Use electronic media where possible and when necessary only use recycled paper

Measure and Report – Continually monitor and report on your recycling program posting goals and results


## Label System

A Smarter Label System
Variation in recycling programs, unclear labeling, and inaccurate recyclability claims make proper recycling a challenge. The How2Recycle label was created to provide consistent and transparent on-package recycling information to consumers in North America


## Recycling fallacies

“I don’t need to worry about separating anything:  I can throw everything into a blue bin and the city will sort it out”
Single stream recycling has led to significant amount of contamination reducing overall value of the materials.

“Formal recycling programs take jobs away.  Let waste lie where it falls”
Not the most effective way to create jobs, create value for consumers and enhance sustainability.

“Products made of more than one material can’t be recycled”
Thanks to consumer demands, product manufacturers have consistently been working on making packaging easier to 
recycle.  Technology exists to segregate materials and make them more useful.

“Everything can only be recycled once anyway, so what’s the point?”
Many common items can be recycled over and over again with substantial savings to energy and natural resources.

“Recycling is a big government overreach with no real benefits to the planet”
The EPA reports that using recycled plastics saves two-thirds of the energy over virgin materials.  Recycling creates new 
jobs and presents a net positive financial benefit.



## Recycling truths

Most of the plastic collected in recycling bins isn’t being recycled

Depressed oil prices affect the value of recycled plastics

There’s 270,000 tons of plastic waste in our oceans worldwide

Compostable plastics are not better for the environment

Alternative materials often consume more energy and resources and are less functional
